We can find the sd of the regression model’s errors is only about 1/10 the size of the sd of the errors that you would get with a constant-only model. Because we only got R- square value around 20% which means the variance of its errors is 20% less than the variance of the dependent variable and the sd of its error is 11% less than the sd of the dependent variable.At the same time, the value of MSE are pretty large, so its not good.\n"
